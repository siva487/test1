I have a Data Factory instance that is connected to a Git repository. 
We would like to change the GitHub username, because it refers to a name of a former colleague. 
I have read the GitHub website about changing your username, 
but I can't seem to find any info on how changing a GitHub username could affect your Azure Data Factory environment. 
Is it just a matter of disconnecting the Git repository and change the settings to the GitHub account with the new username or will this have unintended side effects?
